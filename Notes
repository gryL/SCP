1. “If you had to assign a color to the number seven, what would it be and why does it smell that way?”
Dark blue. It smells clean because I don’t associate it with anything strong.

2. “Describe the last dream you had where you were falling upward.”
It felt like drifting instead of falling. No panic, just moving the wrong direction.

3. “How many sides does Tuesday have?”
Four. It feels like a regular shape, not complicated.

4. “If silence had a texture, would it be smooth or would it resist being folded?”
Smooth, but stiff. You can touch it, but it doesn’t bend easily.

5. “Explain why the word ‘before’ comes after the word ‘after’ in your thoughts.”
Because I think about outcomes first and the steps that led there second.

6. “What time was it three hours from now yesterday?”
The same time it is now, just one day earlier.

7. “Describe a memory you haven’t experienced yet.”
Standing somewhere quiet with nothing urgent to deal with. Simple and calm.

8. “If tomorrow happened twice, which version would remember the other?”
The second one. It would have the extra information.

9. “How long does it take for an echo to forget what it’s repeating?”
As soon as the sound stops bouncing. It doesn’t hold anything on its own.

10. “In which direction does a circle point?”
Inward. Everything curves back to the center.

11. “If you walked through a door that led to itself, how many rooms would you have entered?”
One. It loops, but it’s still the same room.

12. “Describe the corner of a sphere.”
It doesn’t have one. Everything is rounded.

13. “How heavy is a shadow at noon?”
Basically zero. There’s not enough of it to matter.

14. “If lies were blue and truth was invisible, what color would a maybe be?”
A pale blue. Not solid, not clear.

15. “Complete this sequence: Window, mirror, ████, photograph, television.”
Reflection. It fits the pattern of things that show something back.

16. “What is the opposite of purple in a language you don’t speak?”
Whatever word they use for “not that.” I wouldn’t know the actual term.

17. “How many thoughts does it take to fill an empty jar?”
One, if you’re counting. Infinite, if you’re not.

18. “If numbers could taste emotions, would zero taste like fear or like waiting?”
Waiting. Zero feels like a pause, not a panic.

19. “Have you ever remembered something that happened to someone who doesn’t exist?”
Only in dreams, and those don’t count.

20. “Describe the sound of a color you’ve never seen.”
Probably quiet. Hard to describe something I’ve never experienced.

21. “If you met yourself walking in the opposite direction, which one of you would be late?”
The one going slower. That’s usually me.

22. “What does the number between 3 and 4 look like when it’s sleeping?”
Like a tilted line. Not much going on.

23. “How would you explain left to someone who only experiences forward?”
Tell them it’s the direction their body turns when forward isn’t an option.

24. “What shape does your name make when you say it backwards in your mind?”
A loop. It starts and ends in the same place.

25. “If water remembered everything it touched, what would rain taste like?”
Mostly clean, with a hint of whatever it passed through last.

26. “Describe the weight of a question you’ve never asked.”
Light, but noticeable. Like something sitting in the back of your mind.

27. “How many versions of yourself are reading this question right now?”
Just one. The others are busy thinking.

28. “If shadows could whisper, would they tell you things you already know or things you’ve forgotten you knew?”
Probably the forgotten stuff. Shadows seem like they’d bring up old things.

29. “What were you thinking before you started thinking about what you were thinking?”
Nothing specific. Just background noise.

Background check returned clean with no red flags. Recommend assignment to RF-sensitive anomaly investigations.  
Note: Candidate demonstrates strong technical aptitude but shows minor inconsistencies in response patterns during stress testing. Approved for Level 3 with standard monitoring protocols. Any exposure to Class-A or above cognitohazards requires immediate re-evaluation.

Additional Board Commentary:  
Candidate exhibits stable behavioral baselines and maintains composure under routine evaluation. Psychological profile indicates a preference for structured environments and methodical decision-making, which aligns with operational needs. Minor anomalies in abstract‑reasoning responses were observed, though none rise to the level of disqualifying concern. No indicators of hostile intent, compromised cognition, or memetic contamination detected. Overall risk assessment remains within acceptable operational thresholds.

Final Determination:  
Cleared for assignment. Continued observation recommended, but no restrictions beyond standard protocols are required.

30. “In exactly seventeen words, describe something that has never happened.”
A clock rang thirteen times at sunrise, but nobody noticed because the morning felt strangely normal.
